# Papercups + Mattermost Integration

_[Papercups](https://papercups.io/) is an open-source live customer chat tool. We give you a highly customizable chat widget that lets you talk to your users directly._

---

We've been fans of [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) for a long time. Our core values align very well: we're both open-source, privacy-focused, developer-centric companies that believe in customer data ownership and the ability to self-host.

One of our most requested features so far has been an integration with Mattermost. This would make it possible to reply to messages from customers on your website _directly from Mattermost_.

After a couple weeks of hard work, we're excited to announce that the integration is now ready for use!

### Why integrate live chat with Mattermost?

#### Faster response times and better customer support

Most developers hate having to go to another dashboard/website and learn a new UI. Being able to reply directly from a familiar workspace minimizes the friction to respond. This makes for much happier customers ðŸ™‚

#### Understand your customers

One advantage of having everything in a single channel is you can quickly scan through the conversations and get a sense of what people are asking for. Getting a pulse on customer sentiment is crucial to make your product better.

#### Your entire team can participate

Most of your team typically doesn't have any transparency into customer conversations. Linking these conversations to a channel in Mattermost gives your entire team visibility into what your customers are asking for.

#### Own all your customer data

With Papercups and Mattermost you can self-host everything so your data won't leave your servers. This makes it much easier to comply with GDPR and data sovereignty laws.
