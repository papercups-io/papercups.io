# Getting started with bash

_By Kam Leung_

`cd -` When you need to cd to your previous folder

Example:

```bash
workspace > cd papercups
papercups > cd -
/Users/workspace
workspace >
```

`cd !$` When you need to cd to the last argument of the previous command

```bash
workspace > ls papercups
CHANGELOG.md			Procfile			compile				docker-compose.prod.yml		elixir_buildpack.config		index.html			priv
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md		README.md			config				docker-compose.yml		erl_crash.dump			lib				rel
CONTRIBUTING.md			_build				deps				docker-entrypoint-dev.sh			mix.exs				scripts
Dockerfile			app.json			dev.Dockerfile			docker-entrypoint.sh		mix.lock			test
LICENSE				assets				docker-compose.dev.yml		docs			phoenix_static_buildpack.config
workspace > cd !$
cd papercups
papercups >
```

`mdfind` (Mac only) - Search your entire mac for filename or content with that string instantly since macos automatically indexes your files see https://ss64.com/osx/mdfind.html for more details

```bash
papercups > mdfind papercups.png
/Users/Downloads/a84d1a73491349259196f52fbdc53321-Papercups.png

/Users/Downloads/logo-design-a-paper-cups-inspi.zip
/Users/Downloads/File.zip
papercups >

```

`pbcopy` (Mac only) copys content in to your paste buffer

`pbpaste` (Mac only) output the contents of your paste buffer

Two for one example:

```bash
papercups > echo "Papercups Papercups Papercups" | pbcopy
papercups > pbpaste
Papercups Papercups Papercups
```

`wc -l` Gets line count of file

```bash
papercups > ls
CHANGELOG.md			README.md			deps				docker-entrypoint.sh			mix.lock
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md		_build				dev.Dockerfile			docs				phoenix_static_buildpack.config
CONTRIBUTING.md			app.json			docker-compose.dev.yml		echo			priv
Dockerfile			assets				docker-compose.prod.yml		elixir_buildpack.config		index.html			rel
LICENSE				compile				docker-compose.yml		erl_crash.dump			lib				scripts
Procfile			config				docker-entrypoint-dev.sh	file.txt			mix.exs				test
papercups > wc -l README.md
      93 README.md
papercups >
```

`sort` sorts a file by line

`uniq` removes duplicate adjacent lines. I like to combine it with sort to dedupe a file.

`grep` use it to find files but I mostly use it as a way to filter when working with files

`awk` gets specific columns of a file

`|` Pipes output of one command in to the input of another command

I got a little lazy at this point and figure the best way to show case these commands is to chain them together.
I was putting this post together when I wanted to see what are some of my common bash commands so I wrote some bash commands that
looks through my bash history and gets filters out my git and echo commands.

`history | awk -F' ' '{print $2, $3}' | sort | uniq | grep -v 'git\|echo'`

```bash
history | awk -F' ' '{print $2, $3}' | sort | uniq | grep -v 'git\|echo'
cat file.txt
cat results.
cat results.csv
cd -
cd ..
cd ../docs/
cd ../papercups.io
cd ../papercups.io/
cd papercups
cd papercups.io
cd papercups.io/
code .
code index.html
cp results.csv
docs
env
gap
less results.csv
ls
ls papercups
ls results.csv
mdfind
mdfind papercups
mdfind papercups.png
mix phx.server
node
npm install
npm run
open index.html
papercups >
pbcopy |
pbpaste
pbpaste |
rm results.csv
rm results.txt
source .env
stty sane
tail -f
tail results.csv
tail results.txt
touch results.csv
ts-node inspect
ts-node inspeect
vim results.
vim results.csv
vim yc_companies.csv
wc -l
